# GSM Module Baud Rate Detection

## Introduction

This Arduino project is designed to help you determine the suitable baud rate for your GSM module, such as the SIM800L, by testing different baud rates and checking for a response.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- GSM module (e.g., SIM800L)
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## Setup Instructions

1. Connect your GSM module to the Arduino:
   - Connect the GSM module's TX pin to Arduino's RX pin.
   - Connect the GSM module's RX pin to Arduino's TX pin.
   - Make sure to provide power and ground connections as required by your module.

2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`GSM_BaudRate_Detection.ino`) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

3. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor (Tools -> Serial Monitor).

4. Observe the Serial Monitor to see if the GSM module responds to the "AT" command at different baud rates.

5. If you see a response, note the baud rate at which the response occurred. This is the suitable baud rate for your GSM module.

6. If there's no response, try changing the baud rate in the sketch (e.g., to 19200 or 115200) and upload it again. Repeat the process until you receive a response.

7. Once you determine the suitable baud rate, you can use it for further communication with your GSM module in other projects.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the connections between your Arduino and GSM module are correct and secure.
- Make sure your GSM module is powered on and has a valid SIM card.
- Verify that you've selected the correct COM port and baud rate in the Arduino IDE.
- Check the datasheet or documentation of your GSM module for any specific baud rate requirements.
